### Img stim info
There are three different image conditions, corresponding to our three frequencies of interest.

Every second we can present 60 images, based on the refresh rate of a CRT monitor (16.667).

Therefore, our FPS is 60 in all conditions, but the number of images shown within a second will be
more or less depending on the frequency. In faster conditions we will shower more images and in
slower conditions we will show less images.
